# MaskedTextField-SwiftUI

The MaskedTextField-SwiftUI package empowers developers to easily integrate customizable masked text input fields into their SwiftUI applications. Masked text fields provide a structured way for users to input data by enforcing a specific format, such as phone numbers, dates, or credit card numbers, while maintaining a clean and intuitive user experience.

## Key Features

1. Flexible Masking: Define custom masks to specify the format in which user input should be entered, allowing for precise control over the data format.

2. Input Validation: Automatically validate user input against the specified mask, ensuring that only valid data is accepted and processed.

3. Placeholder Support: Provide placeholders that guide users on the expected format for input, improving usability and reducing errors.

4. Dynamic Formatting: Enable dynamic updates to the mask based on user input or application requirements, adapting to various scenarios seamlessly.

5. Customization Options: Customize the appearance and behavior of the masked text field to align with the application's design language and user preferences.

6. Integration with SwiftUI: Seamlessly integrate the masked text field component into SwiftUI views, leveraging SwiftUI's declarative syntax for building user interfaces.

Whether you're building a form for collecting user information, implementing a payment processing system, or creating any other data entry interface, the SwiftUI Masked Text Field package provides a reliable solution for enforcing data format consistency and enhancing user input experiences in SwiftUI applications.
